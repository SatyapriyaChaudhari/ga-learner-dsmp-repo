### Project Overview

 Bank Of New York wants to expand its branches and for that it has certain hypothesis and statements it wants to verify. Using the inferential statistics method, verify the same.


### Learnings from the project

 Concepts applied:

- [ ] Confidence Interval
- [ ] Central Limit Theorem
- [ ] Hypothesis Testing
- [ ] Chi Square Test


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Steps Involved:
1. To check if the mean of installment falls in the range of the confidence interval.
2. Check if Central Limit Theorem holds for installment column.
3. To check the one-sided hypothesis that people with purpose as 'small_business' have been given int.rate more due to the risk assosciated.
4. To check the two-sided hypothesis that monthly installments customers have to pay might have some sort of effect on loan defaulters.
