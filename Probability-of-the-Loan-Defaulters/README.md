### Project Overview

 Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.

Exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com and calculating what is the probability that the borrower paid back their loan in full?


### Learnings from the project

 Concepts applied in this project:

- [ ] Independency check
- [ ] Bayes theorem
- [ ] Visualizing discrete variable
- [ ] Visualizing continuous variable


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 To calculate the joint probability, first step is to check whether the features are independent from each other and visualize the data to get the basic idea about how the distribution of features are.
