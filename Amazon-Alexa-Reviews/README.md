### Learnings from the project

 Topics reinforced while slving the project:
    Posterstemmer
    Text cleaning
    Random forest classifier
    Metrics for classification



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Steps involed:
1. Clean and preprocess the data as many reviews were written in inappropriate manner.
2. Fit the Random Forest Model and check the precision as our main focus is only on checking the negative feedback.
3. As the dataset in imbalanced data where 91% is positive feedback and 9% is negative feedbak, apply the oversampling technic SMOTE and check the accuracy/precision of the model.
