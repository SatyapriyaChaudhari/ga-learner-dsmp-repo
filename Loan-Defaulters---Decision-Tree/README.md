### Project Overview

 Using Decision Tree model, classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.


### Learnings from the project

 Exploring the data with 13 features, visualize the distributions (numerical as well as categorical features) and build a Decision Tree model & check accuracy.
Using grid search to do the optimum pruning, the accuracy score increased from 0.73 to 0.83.
