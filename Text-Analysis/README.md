### Project Overview

 Classify the News Article - to predict which class a particular resource belongs to given the title of the resource.


### Learnings from the project

 Topics reinforced while slving the project:

Preprocess text data with tokenization, stopword removal etc
Vectorize data using Bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches
Apply classifiers (Logistic and Multinomial Naive Bayes) to perform multi-class classification


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Steps involved:

1. Preprocess data to retain only alphabets and remove stopwords and split into training and test sets.
2. After cleaning the data, Vectorize with Bag-of-words and TF-IDF approach.
3. Predicting with Multinomial Naive Bayes and checking the accuracy on both Bag-of-words and TF-IDF approach.
4. Predicting with Logistic Regression and checking the accuracy on both Bag-of-words and TF-IDF approach.
